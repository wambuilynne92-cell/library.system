Assignment 1: Online Library Management System (C++)

This assignment required me to design and implement an Online Library Management System
using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++. The system helps manage books in a
library by allowing users to add, remove, search, borrow, and return books.
The system consists of three main classes: Book, User, and Library.

Book Class
This class represents a book in the library. It stores book details such as ID, title, author, and
availability status.
User Class
This class represents a library user and stores the user ID and name.
Library Class
This class manages all the books in the system and handles adding, removing, searching,
borrowing, and returning books.
The Concepts Used- Encapsulation- Abstraction- Modularity
Test Cases
Positive test cases include adding books and borrowing available books. 
Negative test cases include trying to borrow unavailable books or searching for non-existing books.
